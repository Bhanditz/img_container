	<li>Tips for poker players</li>
</ul>

<p>The very first thing you need to know is the following: poker for play money and <strong>poker for real money</strong> are totally different games in fact. The process of <strong>real money poker game</strong> has many districting features from any other free poker games. Poker for cash differs from a free game in the same as manner as plain beer differs from non-alcoholic one. The name is the same, manufacturers are the same but taste and feeling are totally different.</p>

<p>In the first case (when playing for play money chips) you simply have fun and kill your time, however, in the second case (when playing poker for money) - you turn into a real business, a visionary having an adrenaline rush in the blood.</p>

<h2 class="text">Differences between poker for play money chips and for real money</h2>

<p>You may be the king of the free poker games, become the owner of billions of chips and thus simply waste your time. If you think that poker for chips can teach you anything - you are getting it so wrong. Poker for real money first and foremost will make you treat the game seriously. If you hold responsibly for each your step with real money, you won't probably act hotheadedly. When playing for fun chips, you may call your opponent's bet simply out of curiosity, as it won't cost you anything. However, when playing poker for real money every minute each your decision will provoke money loss or accumulation instead.</p>

<p><strong>Online poker for real money</strong> elicits emotions in you every time. It’s gambling passion as well as joy, anger, disappointment and sometimes the feeling of satisfaction with your own game and what else can be better? Emotions are the absolute miracle that people have and poker for money will give you a chance to feel the vast spectrum of emotions possible.</p>

<p>Each poker player starts realizing sooner or later that poker for fun chips doesn’t bring satisfaction any more and playing for real money is frightful.</p>

<p>There is nothing better than hitting a huge pot at the online poker table. Those feelings will stick into player’s memory forever. The first tournament victory, the first Royal Flush, the firs huge pot at cash table - all that will stay in your memory for long time.</p>

<h2 class="text">Where to play poker for real money?</h2>

<p>Now there are many places in Internet (poker rooms in particular) where you can <strong>play online poker for real money</strong>. Usually, in order to play for cash you simply need to register in any poker room you like and make a deposit. Next, you can join any poker table with suitable stakes and get down to the game.</p>

<p>As we have already mentioned before, so <strong>many poker rooms offer game for real money</strong>. But like all things connected with finance, game for real money should be committed to trustworthy companies which have a many-year market history, have unblemished reputation and positive players' reviews.

<h3 class="green">Can you play poker for real money for free?</h3>

<p>Yes, you had it right: <strong>poker for real money can be played for free</strong>. Everyone can have such a chance. <strong>Poker for real money without any deposits</strong> - is quite real. You can do it in the following ways:</p>

<ul class="yes">
	<li>Win some money in freerolls</li>
	<li>Get <a href="/no-deposit-poker-bonuses/#jump" title="Free poker money no deposit required">free poker money no deposit required</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Fine poker rooms usually offer a bunch of free tournaments where you can win some real money (though not that much). Today many professionals start their career with such freerolls.</p>

<p>Our website has special sections: <a href="/freerolls/freerolls-schedule/" title="Poker freerolls">poker freerolls</a> and <a href="/no-deposit-poker-bonuses/#jump" title="Free poker bankrolls">free poker bankrolls</a>&nbsp;with the best offers for the start of the poker game for real money without any personal deposits.</p>

<p>No deposit bonuses is an excellent choice for those who have already tried freerolls and now is ready to play for real money however has some doubts whether to make deposits or not.</p>

<h3 class="green">How to withdraw money from the online poker room?</h3>

<p>There are no difficulties when withdrawing/depositing money from/in certain poker rooms. Moreover, solid poker rooms offer a vast choice of payment systems so that each player can choose the method of making a deposit, which is the most comfortable for him.</p>

<p>There’s a common rule for all poker rooms, which all players should follow: you are allowed to withdraw money with the payment system you’ve previously used for making deposits.</p>

<p>Let’s find out how it works: for example, you’ve chosen <a href="/poker-rooms/888poker/overview/#jump" title="888Poker">888Poker</a> out of the list of safe poker rooms (for the no-deposit bonus). You won some money with help of the bonus and now want to withdraw it. You’ve made your deposit at 888Poker wit the help of <a href="/payment-systems/skrill/overview/#jump" title="Skrill payment system">Skrill payment system</a> but wish to withdraw the money to your VISA card. Unfortunately, you can’t do this, as the sum of your deposit must be withdrawn with the payment system you’ve used for deposit at the poker room (i.e. Skrill). In case you want to have your money withdrawn on the VISA card, you need to make a deposit using this card and only then the transaction will be approved.</p>

<p>This is the way poker rooms fight illegal money laundering.</p>

<h2 class="text">How to start playing poker for real money</h2>

<p>In any case, whenever you start playing poker for real money, you need to <a href="/knowledge-base/category/poker-rules/how-to-play-poker-ultimate-guide-to-the-rules-of-poker-texas-holdem-part-1-post-2320/#jump" title="Learn how to play poker">learn how to play poker</a> along with basic strategies. You have two options:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Make your personal money deposit. In order to do this you simply need to download the software of the poker room you’ve chosen, make a deposit and start the game. We advise to choose micro limits alone for the game at the very start. This is the fastest and the most efficient way to make a start, however implies personal money deposits.</li>
	<li>If you’re not yet ready to risk your own money, you can also start playing for cash but without any personal deposits. In order to do this, you can start with freerolls (free tournaments with real money prizes) and thus accumulate your own bankroll or get your start-up capital on our website in the form of no-deposit bonus.</li>
</ol>

<p>The second option takes more time as it will take you longer to win a solid bankroll and you won’t get a substantial deposit bonus either. However, many beginner find it more important to have no risks to loose their money, that’s why our website offer the start-up capital.</p>

<p>We hope that you’ll find this article useful. Good luck to your efforts!</p>
