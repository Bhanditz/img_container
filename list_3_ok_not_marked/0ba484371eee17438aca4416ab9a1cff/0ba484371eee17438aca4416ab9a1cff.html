<h2>PokerStars' history milestones</h2>

<p>It was <strong>Isai Scheinberg</strong> - an IT specialist from IBM - who started to develop software for PokerStars in late 90s. In those far-off days virtual poker only started to gain popularity. As the result of Scheinberg’s intensive work, a <strong>beta-version of PokerStars gaming client for play money was launched on September 11, 2001</strong>. Then, on December 12, 2001 users finally got an opportunity to play for real money. In order to manage the brand-new poker room, Rational Enterprises Company was registered in Costa-Rica.</p>

<p><img alt="PokerStars 2001 - lobby" src="/img/content/news-and-promotions/2017/09-september/01/pokerstars.jpg" title="PokerStars 2001 - lobby"></p>

<p>In 2002 PokerStars launched its first satellite tourneys and also arranged a championship - WCOOP (World Championship of Online Poker). Three years past and the poker room had already registered its billion hand.</p>

<p><strong>On March 11, 2006 PokerStars launched a weekly tourney with a guaranteed prize pool of $1 000 000 - Sunday Million</strong>, which had later become the most popular and large-scale regular tournament over the Internet. Interestingly, the tourney has been maintaining this status ever since. The winner of the first Sunday Million tourney became “AAAAAAA” user from the USA,</p>

<p>Starting from March 18, 2008 PokerStars added Russian language to its software.</p>

<p>In 2009 the company created a team of professional players - Team Pro PokerStars, which currently includes many gifted and talented players, who represent PokerStars in many online and live events.</p>

<p>In 2011 FBI brought a charge against all poker rooms, including PokerStars, of fraud and illegal gambling games organization on the territory of the USA. As the result, PokerStars had to leave the US market.</p>

<p>In 2014 the Amaya Company bought out Rational Group, which owned PokerStars.</p>

<p>In 2015 PokerStars returned to the USA market after the Gambling Commission of New-Jersey accepted the submission by Amaya Gaming.</p>

<p>In 2016 the Amaya Company organized a merger between PokerStars and another associate poker room - <a href="/poker-rooms/full-tilt/overview/" title="Full Tilt">Full Tilt</a>.</p>

<h2>PokerStars software</h2>

<p>PokerStars offers really convenient and handy software of a very high quality, which will definitely satisfy the demands of the most sophisticated players. Failures and errors in the software are so rare, that one can count them on the fingers of one hand if taking the whole history of the poker room from the very beginning. PokerStars gaming client is rightly considered top-quality, user-friendly, rich and, what’s extremely important, reliable. The developers have left no stone unturned to make you feel as comfortable as possible and enjoy playing poker for real money and for free at PokerStars tables.</p>

<p>PokerStars software is very quality and secure and moreover it offers players plenty of possibilities: flexible configuration of client, notifications, tables, backs of your playing cards and many things more. Moreover, each player can multitable at up to 24 tables simultaneously, which is very comfortable for many professional players.</p>

<h2>PokerStars: games selection</h2>

<p>PokerStars is rightfully considered to be the biggest online poker room in the world. On average, PokerStars has about 100 000 customers playing poker at the same time and in rush hours this indicator may reach 250 000 and even more. No other poker room can boast of more players, than PokerStars has. There’re quite many weak players, if you choose low-limits; but the higher limits get, the stronger your opponents are. So all in all the average game level on low stakes is very poor, but at the same time higher-stakes players are much stronger than in other poker sites.</p>

<p><strong>PokerStars offers a vast choice of games</strong>: Texas Hold’em, Omaha Hi, Omaha High-Low, 7-card Stud, 7-card Stud High-Low, Razz (7-card Stud-Low), HORSE and a mix of 8 games (mixed games), 5-card draw, 2-7 Draw poker, Badugi.</p>

<p>PokerStars has gained its high popularity thanks to its tourneys - it isn’t that there’re many of them, there’re actually the whole bunch of them. The poker room regularly hosts tourneys with huge prize pools. The best example is “Sunday Million” - regular weekly tournament with a guaranteed prize pool of $1.000.000. PokerStars also hosts online championships like WCOOP or SCOOP with prize pools over $40 million.</p>

<p>Registered players have an excellent chance to play different types of poker, no matter how much money they have on their accounts and whether they have it at all. <strong>When playing at PokerStars, you’re allowed to take part in different varieties of poker games both for real money and for play money</strong>. Poker room treats players, who prefer playing for play money, and players, who choose real money games, equally seriously. In order to make the game for play money chips more dynamic and interesting, PokerStars holds special tournaments with buy-ins in the form of play money.</p>

<p>It’s very easy to choose different varieties of games at PokerStars: in your gaming client you’ll find tables with different games’ types (Cash Games, Tourney, ZOOM and etc.) Moreover, in your clients lobby you may set filters to sort all the games.</p>

<h3>Real money cash tables at PokerStars</h3>

<p>PokerStars gives its players a chance to play different poker types at cash tables. Apart from traditional <a href="/knowledge-base/poker-articles/no-limit-texas-holdem/" title="Texas Hold’em">Texas Hold’em</a> and Omaha, players are offered different types of Stud, 5- and 7-card poker, 5-card Omaha, 2-7 triple Draw, 2-7 Single Draw, Courchevel and some other variations. Most of poker games also feature various bets structures: no-limit, fixed-limit and also pot-limit versions.</p>

<p>In order to take part in the game at one PokerStars cash tables, users have to choose stakes: micro (up to NL16), low (NL16 - NL50), medium (NL50 - NL400) and high (NL400+). The game can be both played at the full ring (7-10 players) and short (6-max) tables. Please remember, that traditional Heads up tables were removed from the lobby in February 2016.</p>

<h3>ZOOM Poker at PokerStars</h3>

<p><img alt="ZOOM Poker" src="/img/content/news-and-promotions/2017/09-september/01/zoom-poker-min.png" title="ZOOM Poker"></p>

<p>This type of a card game involves game at cash-table, but once you fold in a Zoom game, you’ll instantly be dealt a new hand against new opponents. This game is a great option for those, who like to play many hands in a short period of time. If you decide to play at ZOOM tables, you don’t need to wait until the hand is over, but leave it, by pressing “Fast Fold” button. Thus each player can quickly get rid of weak hands and wait for strong ones.</p>

<h3>Sit&amp;Go tournaments</h3>

<p>Sit&amp;Go are tourneys, that start only after a certain number of players confirm registration. They don’t stick to any schedule, but are held on a regular basis (ongoing): as soon as there’re enough people for a tourney, it starts and another tourney opens for registration. The number of participants may vary from 2 to 990 people, and the size of a buy-in can range from $0,02 to $5,000.</p>

<p>Sit&amp;Go tourneys can be held in an unconventional way: they may serve as satellites to bigger multi-table tourneys.</p>

<p>Sit&amp;Go tourneys fall into 3 categories by size: heads up, single table and multi-table. The first category implies heads-up game, the second category implies only 6-max or 9-max tables and the last category implies, that there're 2 or more tables.</p>

<h3>Spin&amp;Go tournaments</h3>

<p><img alt="Spin &amp; Go tournaments" src="/img/content/news-and-promotions/2017/09-september/01/spin-n-go-ept-lobby.jpg" title="Spin &amp; Go tournaments"></p>

<p>Spin&amp;Go is a kind of a Sit&amp;Go tourney with a prize pool chosen randomly right before the game starts. The minimum and the maximum size of prize pool (in money) for each tourney depend on the size of a buy-in as well. Spin &amp; Go Max tournaments are available to play from just $1 and give you the chance to win up to 10,000 times your buy-in. For example, the maximum prize for a $15 tourney is $150 000. The greatest Spin&amp;Go tourney requires a $100 buy-in with a maximum prize equal to $1.000.000.</p>

<p>Spin&amp;Go are Hyper Turbo tournaments. This means, that it's a short-time game. What's interesting about these tourneys: players can both take part in the game and watch other players playing.</p>

<h2>Multi-table tournaments at PokerStars</h2>

<p>PokerStars regularly holds tourneys with thousands of participants. Such wide scale tourneys include WCOOP (World Championship of Online Poker), SCOOP (Spring Championship of Online Poker), MicroMillions and some other series. In addition to that, PokerStars also organizes satellite tourneys for live events like WSOP, EPT, WРТ and etc.</p>

<p>The poker room also regularly hosts tournaments with guaranteed prize pools equal to millions of dollars. You can distinguish several tournaments of such kind, for example, Sunday Million, which is only held on Sundays. The guaranteed prize pool of this tourney equals to $1 000 000 and the average prize for the first place varies from $160 000 to $180 000.</p>

<p>If you open the tab “Tourneys”, you’ll find many multi-table tournaments with 6 different buy-ins levels. First and foremost we should highlight freerolls.</p>

<p><img alt="Real money online poker games" src="/img/content/news-and-promotions/2017/09-september/01/play-money.jpg" title="Real money online poker games"></p>
