                                            <p><a href="http://www.playpokeronline.dk">Playing real money poker</a> in a casino is a lot of fun. It varies   greatly from playing poker for money online and at home. For that   reason, I’ve put together some tips to help play poker for money at a   casino for the first time.</p>
<p>As I consider the tips I want to give you, I am taken back to when I   was a new poker player. I remember the fear and apprehension associated   with playing live poker for money for the first time.</p>
<p>There are so many things that first-time poker players don’t know   about how live casino poker differs from the usual home game. I hope   that as a new poker player you gain some insight and ultimately feel   much more comfortable with your live poker experience.</p>
<h2>Choose the right casino poker game for your bankroll</h2>
<p>Most casino poker rooms play the same games on a regular basis. It   would be best to know well in advance what game you want to play.</p>
<p>Some common live poker games you’ll find are,</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Limit Texas Hold’em</strong> – While the blinds are only   $1 /$2 or      $2 /$5, you can bet all your chips at any time. The   minimum buy-in is      generally $40-$100 and many of the poker rooms   have nearly      eliminated the maximum you can buy-in.
<ul>
<li><strong>! A Word of Caution! – </strong>Unless you       have a   large bankroll or plenty of extra cash, I recommend that you start         by playing Fixed Limit Texas Hold’em. Once you feel confident at the         Limit tables, you can move up to the “big game”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Limit Texas Hold’em</strong> – These games come in both   structured and      unstructured formats and are generally the best for   new players to gain      live poker experience.
<ul>
<li><strong>Structured – </strong>Typically, the games       are $3/$6   and $4/$8. So in a $3/$6 game, the small blind is $1 and the       big   blind is $3. You bet in increments of $3 on the flop. The bet goes up         to $6 on both the turn and river. If you raise it goes to $12, and a         re-raise takes it to $18. In a 4/8 game, the blinds are $2 and   $4, with a       fixed bet of $4 on the flop, and $8 on the turn and   river.
<ul>
<li><strong>Sub-tip – </strong>Memorize the betting        structures   outlined here! This is a common beginner mistake. It’s no big          deal to get involved in a huge pot and forget how much you can raise the          bet. However, asking every hand “how much can I bet?” gets old   to other        players and the dealer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Unstructured – </strong>A common form of casino poker is   unstructured Hold’em, or 1-4-8-8. The blinds are $1 and $2 and the         betting is unstructured within those set limits. Before the flop, you   can       raise to $4, $5, or $6. (You can’t make it $3 because any  time  you raise       it must at least double the previous bet) On the  flop  you can bet from       $1-$4 and the turn and river you can bet  $1-$8.  It can get confusing       sometimes. For example, on the turn,  someone  bets out $4 and you want to       raise the most you can. Some  newer  players think they can only make it       $8, but since it’s   unstructured, you can actually raise the bet to $12       (the initial   $4 plus a maximum raise of $8).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2>How to Get in a Live Poker Game</h2>
<p>When you arrive at the poker room, you will usually notice a podium   or central location where players are going to sign up. Now that you’ve   picked out your game of choice, you just walk up and ask if they have  an  available seat. If they do, you will be able to buy your chips from   this person, a chip runner, or a chip station.</p>
<p>If there are no available seats, they will add your name to the list.   Most people give their first name and last initial (i.e. Kevin G, Mike   B, Kenny T). When it’s your turn, the floor person will call your  name.</p>
<p>Some casinos have begun using those things you get at restaurants   that blink and vibrate when your seat is available. They may also take   your cell phone number and call you when your seat is open.</p>
<p>If you aren’t given one of these options, chances are they will   either loudly announce your name in the room or over the PA system. In   poker rooms like this, it’s a good idea to hang nearby so you don’t miss   your seat.</p>
<h2>How Much Money Should You Buy-in For?</h2>
<p><strong>Answer: NOT the minimum!</strong></p>
<p>This happens all the time. A new player wants to try out live poker   and asks what the buy-in is. When the floor manager says “$40”, they   think “Hey, that’s not too bad, I’ll give it a shot”. However, the math   and psychology behind purchasing the minimum in chips make it a bad   decision. Here’s why.</p>
<p>The math part is that in a 1-4-8-8 game, you have only five big bets.   (5 x $8 max bet on turn and river = your $40 minimum buy-in). What   you’ll quickly learn about poker is that there are inevitable ‘swings’   where you may win or lose. Sometimes, I may go way up or down in the   first hour of live poker play. A couple of weeks ago I had Aces and   Kings my first two hands and lost big pots on them both. Had I only   bought in for forty dollars, I would have been out in just two hands!</p>
<p>So many times new players come in the game with their $40 in chips   only to be out in under an hour after taking a couple of beats. This is   exactly what happened to me my first couple of times playing live  poker.  I bought in for forty, played too many hands, called too much,  and I  was out. I chalked it up to bad luck and went on my way.</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb is to have 25 big bets (in a limit game) in   front of you at any given time. This is so that if you have a monster   hand you could conceivably cap the betting on every street. Personally, I   don’t believe you have to follow that rule as most people in a limit   game buy-in for $100 (or a rack-of-white as it’s referred to as). I will   usually just buy another $60-$100 if my stack gets below $40.</p>
<p>In a no limit game, I would never buy in for less than $200 and even   that much may put you at risk. Since many of these games now allow   players to buy-in for $300-infinity.</p>
<p>The psychology behind this is that by buying the minimum in chips you   advertise “Hey I’m a new player and have no clue what I’m doing”. You   become a target right away. Remember the popular saying from the movie   Rounders, “If you can’t spot the sucker in the first half hour at the   table, then you ARE the sucker.” Don’t buy in as the sucker.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sub-Poker Tip</strong> – Consequently, if you see other   players      re-buying or buying into a game for the minimum, realize   they are probably      new, not very good or broke.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Understanding and Getting Comps</h2>
<p>If you follow the advice above and buy in for at least $100 in a   limit game and $200 in a no limit game, chances are you’ll be playing   for several hours. Hopefully, you’ll be having a good time and raking   some big pots too. Eventually, winning all that money will make you   hungry.</p>
<p>Therefore, you need to know how to get the most from your time   playing poker by taking advantage of casino comps. Comps are just the   casinos way of either thanking you for your play or enticing you to play   more.</p>
<p>All poker rooms do their comps differently. However, every poker room   that I know of requires you to have a player’s card. I’ve seen many  new  people who refuse to get one. I’m not why that is.&nbsp; One certainty  is  that they’re missing one of the best benefits of playing live poker.</p>
<p>Every casino poker room does their comps a little different. Some   poker rooms comp so much per hour of play and some have a fixed amount.   Other times the floor person will use his or her discretion. That’s why   it’s a good idea to not only get to know the floor people, but also  tip  them when they’re doing a good job. Trust me; they’ll make sure  you’re  taken care of.</p>
<h2>The Fundamentals of Live Poker – How to Check, Call, Bet, and Raise</h2>
<p>Following the face paced action of casino poker, is one of the   hardest adjustments you’ll have to make. If you master these tips, you   will feel more confident and won’t have to worry about the dealer or   other players getting on your case.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Act in turn – </strong>Although you should be able to follow   where the      action is, the dealer will let you know when it’s your   turn. He will also      let you know if the pot has been raised or   whether it’s your turn to post      the small or big blind. Make sure   you do everything in turn. If you act      out of turn you may mess up   the action after you or change what someone      else was about to do.</li>
<li><strong>Get your bet past the line</strong> <strong>but don’t splash</strong>–   When it’s your turn and you wish to call,      bet, or raise you need   to make sure to place your bet past the line in      front of you.   “Splashing the pot”, is when you just toss chips into the      center of   table where they mix with the rest of pot. In a casino poker      game   the bets should be placed just pass the line not thrown in the        middle. <strong> </strong></li>
<li><strong>Avoid string-bets/raises – </strong>This is a crucial   concept that all      new plays should comment to memory right now!&nbsp; In   the movies, you’ll see poker players      say something like, “I’ll see   your $10 and raise you $20”, while going      back for more chips.  This  is probably the most common mistake I see new      poker players  make.  If you want to raise the bet, just announce, “Raise”      and  then you  can go back and forth to come up with the right amount. Or,       count  out the amount you want to bet and then put it past the line  in one       motion.&nbsp; <strong> </strong></li>
<li><strong>It’s FREE to “check” – </strong>Remember, if you’re in the   big blind      you’ve already paid to see a flop. As long as no one   raises, the dealer      will give you the option of “checking” or   “raising” – if you check he will      deal the flop. The same concept   applies to once the flop is dealt. Even if      you didn’t hit a big   hand on the flop, it’s free for you to check. If no      one has bet,   don’t make the mistake of just folding your cards. You might      get a   free card to give you a better hand or draw. <strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2>Learn and Follow Proper Poker Etiquette</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep      your cards in plain sight.</strong> To control the   integrity of the game, and      avoid any problems if the bad beat   jackpot hits, all players should keep      their cards on the table at   all times. You should refrain from picking the      cards up and holding   them close to your face or body. Instead, you should      simply cover   your cards with one hand and lift the corner of each card to      get a   peak. It’s also a good idea to place a chip on top of the two cards        to let the dealer know your hand is still live.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid      discussing hands in play. </strong>Poker is a   social game by nature. It’s often      tempting to discuss what you   folded when it would have made a big hand.      For example, say the   flop comes 4-4-4 and you folded K4 avoid yelling      “OMG! I folded the   4!!!” You need to avoid saying anything that might      influence the   way others play their hands. Saying things like “I know that      guy   has the flush” or “He’s bluffing!” when you’re not in the hand, is a        big no-no. Now, if it becomes heads up with you and one other player,   you      can say whatever you want about the hand.</li>
<li><strong>One      person to a hand.</strong> This builds off the   previous reminder, but is still      a big deal. You should not discuss   your hand with anyone else during play.      I’ll give you two good   examples of when I broke this rule as a new poker      player.
<ul>
<li>The first time my wife and I       had the opportunity to play live   poker I was too nervous. So, I let my       wife sit down while I   watched. She would show me her cards and throughout       the hand, I   would mumble things about how to play it. The dealer quickly         noticed and said “one person per hand sir”.</li>
<li>Another time I sat next to a       woman that got involved in a big   pot. On the river, she was faced with       calling another bet. She   held up her hand where those next to her could       plainly see. I   noticed she had the best hand possible, but she was       hesitating to   call (because I don’t think she realized what she had). I        casually  said, “Well you’ve got the straight”. OOPS, big mistake! She        made  the call and won the pot. The dealer and others made it clear  how        un-cool it was for me to say something. From then on, I’ve  made sure to        avoid commenting on others’ hands.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2>Don’t Forget to Tip the Dealer</h2>
<p>Most dealers work hard to provide a smooth, stress-free, game for all   players. Just like waiters, poker dealers depend on tips to pay the   bills. A good rule of thumb for most local poker games is $1 for a   medium-sized pot and $2 for a large pot. If I really like the dealer,   I’ll be more liberal with my tips. Conversely, if a dealer is   disrespectful to my wife or me, they go on what we call “tip   restriction”. Instead of getting mad and having words, we simply stop   tipping that dealer. We let our money do the talking!</p>
<h2>Always Protect Your Hand</h2>
<p>In live casino poker, you are always responsible for your own hand. This includes the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you toss your cards into the muck (the      pile of   discarded/folded cards) your hand is automatically dead and cannot        win the pot</li>
<li>If you win the pot by causing everyone to      fold with a bet or by   showing the best hand, you should hold on to your      cards until you   are being pushed the pot.</li>
<li>Always make sure the dealer gives you two      cards.</li>
<li>If you or the dealer accidentally flips      one of your cards over   during the deal, just leave it face up. The dealer      will announce   the card to everyone and make it the burn card. You will be      given a   new card to replace it. Please avoid getting angry when the dealer        flips a big card over. You wouldn’t get upset if the dealer flipped   over a      deuce and then replaced it with an ace to give you pocket   aces. As long as      the dealer isn’t making the same mistake every   deal, there’s no reason to      get frustrated.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Know and Understand Your Opponents</h2>
<p>New players shouldn’t be concerned over poker tells their first   several times at the casino. Getting used to the flow of the game will   be enough to focus on. It’s still a good idea to know and understand the   different opponents you’ll face at the casino.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recreational      players</strong> – Some people simply love   to play poker. It’s not about      winning or losing, it’s about  having  a good time. You’d love to see a      table full of this group!  You  should always do your best to make this      group feel  comfortable.  Never get angry or berate such players. It will      make  them play  better against you, or worse, cause them to leave.</li>
<li><strong>The      Gamblers</strong> – Another breed of recreational   player is the gambler. These      players are used to betting $50 a hand   on the Blackjack table, $5 slot      machines, or betting big on   sporting events. They often come to the poker      table with more than   enough money and will happily bet, call, raise, and      bluff all  night  long. While it’s usually good to have one or two gamblers      at  the  table to build monster pots, it can get costly when they get lucky        or pick up a big hand.</li>
<li><strong>Poker      room regulars</strong> – This includes a variety of individuals including retirees,      students, and dealers who are about to start a shift.</li>
<li><strong>Poker      pros</strong> – Because of the growing popularity   of live and online poker,      more people are taking their shot at   becoming a poker pro. At lower      stakes, you shouldn’t worry about   running into many pros. At the larger      stakes, you should seek to   identify, and play cautiously against, pro      players.</li>
