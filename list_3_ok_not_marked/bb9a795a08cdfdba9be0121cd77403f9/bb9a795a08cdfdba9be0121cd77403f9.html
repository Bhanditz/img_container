      The white knight is a Scatter symbol
      and also triggers a Bonus round when at least two appear on a winning line from left to right.<br>
      The Scatter bonus game is pretty interesting. At least the first two reels are held and the others respin up to 10 times to try and make more scatter wins.<br>

      All wins are doubled as well during the free spins allowing for even greater returns..
      <br>

      <em>Mile  High</em> is a fun game in the 5-reel 25-payline format. The  theme  is a comical take on air travel, and a love affair of sorts between the  stewardess and the passenger. There are two wilds in the games, and the bonus  features are pretty impressive. The symbols on the reels include air travel  icons and the standard high playing card values. The animations of certain  winning combinations will put a smile on the players face, and the music stays  in tune with the theme very well. The design is basic in the layout, but the  concept of the game is quite unique.. 
      When three airplane scatters trigger the free spin  feature, players are given many choices between number of spins and  multipliers. The players can choose from; 12, 8 or 5 free games and the  multipliers differ between them. Additionally, if both wilds appear on the  reels during the free games, the multiplier is even higher. This feature may be  re-triggered indefinitely.<br>
      There is another small bonus feature available in the Kiss Kiss Bonus.<br>
      When three 'Smooch' symbols appear on the reels,  players are able to choose from them to award bonus prizes which could multiply  the players total bet up to 50x. Reveal the Win All kiss and players will win  all the prizes available.<br>

  <br>
   <strong>Agent Cash</strong> Slot is a great 5-reel / 30 winline, Secret Agent based game.<br>
      Graphics and sounds are first class
      with some superb James Bond 'inspired' guitar riffs and sounds. 
      The symbols reflect all the usual 007 themes - Beautiful ladies, fast cars, high tech gadgets etc. 
      A random Vertical Wild can appear, turning an entire reel into a 'Stacked Wild' symbol. 
      There is also great triple-option bonus game when the bonus icons appear on reels 1, 3, and 5.
      You can win an instant cash prize, free spins, or a 'Pick or Die' game.<br>
      The best one is the free spin round, as it includes an 'exploding reels' feature where bullets are fired
      across the screen, turning up to 15 symbols into Wilds.
      As you can imagine, this can enable some massive wins.<br>
      With all these Wilds flying about in the bonus game, prizes seem to be slightly reduced in the main game to compensate. This is what you would call a 'high variance' slot - an all-or-nothing game.
      Fewer small wins, but a higher chance of some huge wins..<br>
  <br>
      Other games include: 
      JurassicSlots , Butterflies , Hurdy Gurdy, Paradise Riches, Big Foot,  California Gold..<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Jurassic Slots</strong> is our favorite out of the new slots. Every casino seems to have a dinosaur slot and this is definitely one of the better ones. It has an all original game style - not just a clone of a previous game with different symbols. <br>
      Graphics and sounds are fantastic with smooth animations and an exciting atmosphere.<br>
      There is a free spin round with Held Wilds that stay in place, and also a nice multi-level bonus game with you pick various locations to increase your prize fund. <br>
      At the end, you can choose to get in the helicopter and leave the island with your loot, or trade it all in for a key to the secret vault..  <br>
Top prize is a cool $50,000 for 5 Wild T-Rex symbols. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>FireHawk</strong>, Beat the Bank, Shaark, Vampire Vixens - All new fun games to play. <strong><br>
      </strong>FireHawk especially is great fun. There is a cool Native American theme with Indian Chiefs and Maidens, Dream Catchers and the mythical Fire Hawk rising out of the flames..<br>
      Sounds are great and the symbols are nicely animated with tribal dances etc..<br>
      <br>
      <img src="images/grail-bonus.jpg" width="220" height="165"><br>
  <br>
  <em><strong>Grail Maiden</strong></em> - new 'all pays' concept slot with hundreds of ways to win - the symbols can be in in any order.

<strong>Mega Moolah jackpot - now added to more games</strong><br>
<br>
</em> To enable the progressive jackpot to rise even faster, it has been linked to several games withing the casino including some popular older ones which have been updated. 5 wheel Drive was one such older slot at MG casinos, with pretty basic features. I was brought completely up to date with modern smooth animated symbols, great gameplay and fun sounds. The main addition though is the MEGAMOOLAH jackpot wheel. This is the second game to feature this spinning wheel bonus with four jackpots - The mini, minor, major and mega jackpots. The Mega jackpot resets to at least a million pounds.<br>
There is also a nice 10 free spins round with a 5x multiplier, when 3 cop cars appear scattered across the screen. 
Hit the highway at 32 Red and other MG casinos.<br>
The MegaMoolah jackpot is now also enabled on the popular Summertime game and the official Batman slot -  DARK KNIGHT.<br>

      <span class="red">Hot</span> - <a href="http://www.livegames.co.uk/live-slots.html">Live Slots</a>. The popular UK licensed  <a href="http://record.betsafe.com/_-2llzSq89DMnqoJ5fuE-l2Nd7ZgqdRLk/1/">BETSAFE</a> casino has added the Mermaids fortune live slot game, where a girl dressed in a mermaid costume, spins the bonus wheel in the bonus round. This is good fun - the mermaid is very excitable and urges on bigger prizes and the jackpot segment..  Players have to collect at least 50 pearls in the basic game to qualify for the live bonus. The bonus wheel is spun every 9 minutes, with the mermaid giving three spins of the wheel, unless it hits a black segment. There are three different prize levels - Bronze, Silver and Gold - which are activated if you have 50, 100, or 200 pearls.<br>
      This is great fun to play and the first game of its kind. <em>(update - no longer available, sadly)</em><br>
      Betsafe Casino also has a good choice in other games, including Williams Slots which are only licensed to a select few casinos. These include Wizard of Oz, Zeus III, Bier Haus. Ruby Slippers, and Super Jackpot Party.
