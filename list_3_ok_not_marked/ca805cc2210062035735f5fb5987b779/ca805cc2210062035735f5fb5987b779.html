        <a class="accordion-item" href="#">What do I do if I have a winning ticket? How do I claim my prize?</a>
        <div>
            <p>If you find out that you have a winning ticket, congratulations! All winners are advised to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Sign the back of your ticket. Only one person or entity can claim the prize. If there is more than one winner, the Lottery office will assist you with the appropriate paperwork for filing your claim and tax liabilities.</li>

        <div>
            <p>For prizes of $600 or less, complete the information on the back of a winning ticket, make sure you have signed the ticket, and mail it to:</p>

        </div>
        <a class="accordion-item" href="#">Do I need my ticket in order to pick up my prize?</a>
        <div>
            <p>Yes! You must present your game ticket in order to receive your winnings.</p>
        </div>
        <a class="accordion-item" href="#">Why should I sign my ticket?</a>
        <div>
            <p>Like currency or dollar bills, Lottery tickets are 'bearer instruments' in that the holder of the ticket is the owner, unless the ticket is signed. By signing the back of your Lottery ticket, you make the ticket officially "yours." Only the person whose name matches the signature on the ticket may claim its winnings.</p>
        </div>
        <a class="accordion-item" href="#">What happens if my ticket gets lost or stolen?</a>
        <div>
            <p>You must present your winning ticket in order to claim your prize. Without your ticket, there is no proof of ownership and, therefore, you will not be able to collect your winnings. In the event your ticket is lost or stolen, signing your ticket acts as a security measure against someone else trying to claim your prize. As the ticket owner, your signature must match that on the back of ticket in order to claim. If you misplace your ticket and do not redeem it within the 180 day claim period, you will forfeit your prize.</p>
        </div>
        <a class="accordion-item" href="#">What happens if I'm not the only winner?</a>
        <div>
            <p>If more than one <em>Lotto</em>, <em>Hit 5</em>, <em>Mega Millions</em> or <em>Powerball</em> <sup>®</sup> ticket has matched all the winning numbers, the jackpot prize is divided equally. Top prizes in <em>Daily Game</em>, <em>Daily Keno</em>, <em>Scratch</em> and <em>Match 4</em> are not divided among multiple winners – each winner wins the full prize amount.</p>
        </div>
        <a class="accordion-item" href="#">I am not a U.S. citizen. Can I win the jackpot?</a>
        <div>
            <p>Yes. You do not need to be a U.S. citizen to play or to claim a prize. Non US residents will be required to provide an address outside of the U.S. and 30 percent of the prize amount will be automatically deducted for federal taxes.</p>
        </div>
        <a class="accordion-item" href="#">How long do I have to claim my winnings?</a>
        <div>
            <p>Winners have 180 days from the drawing date to claim their prize. Scratch ticket winners have 180 days from the official end of the game to claim their prize. You can find the official end of game date for individual games on their detail pages or by calling Customer Service.</p>
        </div>
        <a class="accordion-item" href="#">What is the difference between claiming cash or annuity options?</a>
        <div>
            <p>Cash Option:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Lotto</em>: Winners are paid 50% of the advertised jackpot.</li>
                <li><em>Mega Millions</em> and <em>Powerball</em> <sup>®</sup>: cash amount is calculated based on the bond factor the day the winner claims the prize.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Annuity Options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Lotto</em>: Annuity option is paid out over 25 years.</li>
                <li><em>Mega Millions</em>: Prize is paid over 30 years with a 5% increase each year.</li>
                <li><em>Powerball</em> <sup>®</sup>: Prize is paid over 30 years with a 4% increase each year.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <a class="accordion-item" href="#">Do jackpot winners get interest on the 25-year annuity?</a>
        <div>
            <p>No interest is paid. The Lottery purchases securities which mature over time to cover the payment to the winner.</p>
        </div>
        <a class="accordion-item" href="#">How long do jackpot winners have to make their choice after they claim their prize?</a>
        <div>
            <p>Winners have 60 days after claiming their jackpot prize at a Lottery office to make their choice, whether they choose the annuity or cash option. Winners who do not make a choice within 60 days will receive their prize as an annuity.</p>
        </div>
        <a class="accordion-item" href="#">What happens if a jackpot winner dies before receiving all of their payments?</a>
        <div>
            <p>By law, the remaining installment payments become part of the winner's estate in the event his/her death precludes collecting full payment. The winner's estate has the option, in most cases, of continuing to receive annual payments or requesting that the Lottery Director allow a one-time payment of the current cash value of the remaining winnings.</p>
        </div>
        <a class="accordion-item" href="#">Do I have to claim taxes on my prize?</a>
        <div>
            <p>Lottery prizes are considered earned income by the federal government. The Lottery is required to report any single prize of over $600 to the IRS. If the prize is over $5,000 the Lottery is required to withhold 25% for US Residents (and 30% for Non-resident aliens) and forward taxes to IRS at the time the prize is paid. Winners will be sent a W-2G form by the end of January in compliance with IRS requirements to use in filing their tax returns.</p>
        </div>
        <a class="accordion-item" href="#">Can I have more taxes withheld if I choose?</a>
        <div>
            <p>Yes, if your prize is over $5,000. Simply let the Lottery customer service representative who handles your prize claim know the amount you'd like withheld before claiming your prize.</p>
        </div>
        <a class="accordion-item" href="#">Are any other monies taken out of my prize?</a>
        <div>
            <p>Washington's Lottery is required to check for debts owed to the State of Washington on prizes over $600. Debts owed to the state, such as child support payments, will be subtracted from the prize amount prior to prize payment.</p>
        </div>
        <a class="accordion-item" href="#">Can I remain anonymous if I claim by establishing a trust?</a>
        <div>
            <p>As a public agency, all documents held by Washington's Lottery are subject to the Public Records Act. Lottery prizes may be claimed in the name of a legally formed entity, such as a trust. However, in the event of a public records request, the documents forming the artificial entity may be released, thereby revealing the individual names of winners.</p>
        </div>
        <a class="accordion-item" href="#">I won as part of a "Group Play". Do we all claim the prize?</a>
        <div>
            <p>Washington's Lottery pays only individuals or legal entities whose formation papers are consistent with WAC 315-06-120 and approved by the Director at the time of claim.</p>
        </div>
        <a class="accordion-item" href="#">I won! Can I give the ticket to a family member?</a>
        <div>
            <p>If the ticket is unsigned, anyone can claim the prize. If the ticket is signed, the claimant can sign the ticket over to another person if they so choose. A notarized letter or <a href="assets/docs/B143b.pdf" target="_blank">this form</a> will be required.</p>
        </div>
        <a class="accordion-item" href="#">Received an email/letter/phone call from someone telling me I won. Is it legitimate?</a>
        <div>
            <p><strong>Did you enter a  drawing for a Second Chance Prize?</strong> The Lottery may  contact you by phone or email as stated in the promotion details. If you want  to verify the identity of the caller, get the caller's name, and then call  1-800-545-7510 and ask to be transferred to  that employee.</p>
            <p>Washington's Lottery does not collect personal information at the point of sale for draw games. Having no way of knowing who has purchased a winning ticket we will never contact you regarding a jackpot win.</p>
