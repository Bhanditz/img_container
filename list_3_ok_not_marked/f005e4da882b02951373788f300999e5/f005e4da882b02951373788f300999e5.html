                          <p>Mavis Wanczyk of Chicopee, MA is the sole winner of a $758.7  million <strong>Powerball </strong>jackpot after the numbers on her lucky ticket matched the  first five winning numbers plus the <strong>Powerball </strong>(06-07-16-23-26, PB 04) selected  in the drawing held Wednesday, August 23, 2017.&nbsp; It is the  largest jackpot prize won on a single ticket in U.S. lottery history.</p>
                          <p>Wanczyk, who was joined by her mother and two sisters at the  Lottery’s Braintree headquarters to claim her prize, chose the cash option on  her prize and will receive a lump sum payment of $480,500,936.&nbsp; After taxes, her check will amount to $336,350,655.</p>
                          <p>Wanczyk purchased a total of five tickets, three with numbers that  she selected and two Quic Pics, at the Pride Station &amp; Store location at 27  Montgomery St. in Chicopee.&nbsp; Her winning  combination was one of the sets of numbers that she selected herself using  family birthdates and her lucky number 4.&nbsp;  The store will receive a $50,000 bonus for its sale of the jackpot  winning ticket.</p>
                          <p>Wanczyk, age 53, who has worked at Mercy Medical Center in  Springfield for the past 32 years, indicated that she has already informed her employer  that she will not be returning.</p>
                          <p>Wanczyk is the fourth <strong>Powerball</strong> jackpot winner in Massachusetts since  the Mass. Lottery began offering the game in 2010.&nbsp; The previous jackpots were won in 2011 ($25.6  million), 2012 ($50 million) and 2013 (half of a $122.9 million jackpot).</p>
                          <p>Previously, the largest jackpot prize ever won on a ticket sold by  the Mass. Lottery was a $294 million <strong>Mega Millions</strong> jackpot prize in 2004.</p>
                          <p>Tickets sold at Sandy’s Variety in Dorchester and at Handy Variety  in Watertown each won a $1 million prize in Wednesday’s drawing by correctly matching  the first five winning numbers.&nbsp; These  retailers will receive a $10,000 bonus.</p>

                            <p><em><strong>Third Consecutive Year of Record-Setting Profit</strong></em></p>
                            <p>BOSTON, MA – State Treasurer Deborah Goldberg announced today that, for the first time in its 45-year history, the Massachusetts State Lottery surpassed the $1 billion mark in net profit for a single fiscal year, producing an estimated $1.035 billion for the Commonwealth in the recently completed 2017 fiscal year.  This is the third consecutive year that the Lottery has posted a record-setting profit, eclipsing the FY16 figure of $989.4 million by more than $46 million.  The Lottery is the single largest source of unrestricted local aid for the Commonwealth’s 351 cities and towns.</p>
                            <p>For the third consecutive fiscal year, the Lottery’s estimated sales topped $5 billion.  Estimated sales of $5.093 billion are second only to FY16’s $5.233 billion.  The Lottery’s fiscal year commenced July 1, 2016 and ended June 30, 2017. </p>
                            <p>“This is a proud moment for the Lottery,” said Goldberg, who as Treasurer and Receiver General serves as Chair of the Massachusetts State Lottery Commission.  “During uncertain times, we were able to increase unrestricted local aid to the cities and towns throughout the Commonwealth.  The team achieved these goals by increasing efficiencies and creative utilization of resources, so necessary in an ever changing environment.”</p>
                            <p>The Lottery spent an estimated $97.4 million on administrative costs in FY17, 5 percent less than the $102.7 million it spent in FY16.  These costs are less than 2 percent of overall revenues, the lowest of any U.S. lottery. </p>
                            <p>As an example of improved efficiency, Treasurer Goldberg cited a re-evaluation of sales routes that allowed Lottery account managers to spend additional time meeting with Lottery retailers, while reducing driving time and mileage.</p>
                            <p>The Lottery awarded an estimated $3.668 billion in prizes in FY17.  With an estimated 72.02 percent of all revenue returned to players in the form of winnings in FY17, the Massachusetts Lottery maintains the highest payout percentage of any lottery in the country.  Prize payouts can fluctuate from year to year based on the schedule or rate at which players cash in their prizes.  The Lottery’s network of retailers collectively earned an estimated $291.9 million in commissions and bonuses in FY17.</p>
                            <p>Instant Tickets accounted for an estimated $3.5 billion in sales, a 2.7 percent decrease from FY16’s record-setting figure of $3.615 billion.  KENO sales rang in at an all-time high estimated at $915 million, a 1.1 percent increase over FY16, due in part to the continued expansion of the number of agents offering the product.  All or Nothing, a new monitor game introduced early in FY17, generated an estimated $18.8 million in sales, a 755 percent increase over the $2.2 million in FY16 sales of the game it replaced, Jackpot Poker.</p>
                            <p>FY16’s record-setting sales figure was bolstered by a sequence of Powerball jackpots that culminated with a U.S. Lottery record $947.9 million jackpot, followed by a world-record jackpot of $1.586 billion.  Those two drawings alone attracted over $56.8 million in sales in Massachusetts in FY16.  Powerball sales for FY17 totaled $117.3 million, a $47.2 million decrease from FY16’s figure.</p>
                            <p>“The successful launch of the All or Nothing game and the growth of our KENO to-go product, both of which are complemented by a mobile app that allows players to watch drawings on a smartphone or tablet, played a significant role in offsetting the decreases in instant ticket and Powerball sales and helping us return an unprecedented level of profit,” said Michael Sweeney, the Lottery’s Executive Director.  “This achievement is the result of a collaborative effort that includes the Treasury, our commissioners, our dedicated Lottery workforce, and our retail partners throughout the Commonwealth.”</p>
                            <p>While the FY17 figures have not been formally audited, the Lottery does not expect them to change substantially once that annual review process is complete.  Lottery officials anticipate completing the finalized financial statement of operations by mid-September.</p>
                            <p>The Massachusetts State Lottery was created in 1972 to generate much-needed local aid revenues for the Commonwealth’s cities and towns.  Since its inception, the Lottery has returned more than $25 billion in net profit to the Commonwealth. </p>

                            <p><em>Drive is supporting local “Toys for Tots” programs, while raising awareness that lottery tickets are not suitable gifts for children</em></p>
                            <p>The  Massachusetts State Lottery is encouraging customers to participate in its  Holiday Toy Drive to benefit the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve Toys for Tots  program, while raising awareness that lottery tickets are not suitable gifts  for children. </p>
                            <p>From  now through Friday, December 16, new, unwrapped toys can be dropped off at the  Lottery’s Braintree headquarters and at its New Bedford, Springfield, Woburn and  Worcester regional offices.&nbsp; Hours are  Monday through Friday, 8:45 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.&nbsp;  Toys will be donated to Toys for Tots campaigns in the respective  regions.&nbsp; </p>
                            <p>“Lottery  employees have been loyal contributors to Toys for Tots for many years through  our internal program and this year we are pleased to extend this effort to  include our customers,” said Michael Sweeney, Executive Director of the Mass.  Lottery.&nbsp; “By putting the focus on giving  toys to children, this is also a great opportunity to remind the public that  while lottery tickets may be great gifts for adults, they are not appropriate  gifts for anyone under the age of 18.”</p>
                            <p>The  Mass. Lottery joins lotteries across North America on an annual basis in  participating in a Lottery Holiday Campaign conducted by the National Council  on Problem Gambling and the International Centre for Youth Gambling Problems  and High-Risk Behaviors at McGill University.&nbsp;  The mission of the campaign is to promote responsible lottery play by  discouraging the giving of lottery tickets as gifts to children.</p>

                            <p>The Massachusetts State Lottery has launched its first  mobile application – MA Lottery 2nd Chance – making it easier for players  to enter Second Chance Drawings in the new <strong>Monopoly™ Jackpot</strong> instant game.</p>
                            <p>With the new app, players can enter <strong>Monopoly Jackpot</strong> Second  Chance Drawings by scanning their non-winning tickets using an auto-focus camera  on a supported device instead of manually entering numbers from their tickets.&nbsp; To utilize this function, players must be  registered in the Lottery’s Red Carpet VIP Club.&nbsp; The app allows existing VIP Club members to  use their current login information to access their accounts and offers players  who aren’t currently enrolled the opportunity to register for a VIP Club  account.</p>
                            <p>The app contains all other information pertaining to the  <strong>Monopoly Jackpot</strong> Second Chance Drawings, including entry deadlines, prize  descriptions, prize winners, complete rules and answers to frequently asked  questions.</p>
                            <p>The app can be downloaded from the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ma-lottery-2nd-chance/id1142242108?mt=8">Apple App Store</a> and the  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mdi.malottery">Google Play Store</a>.</p>
                            <p>Non-winning <strong>Monopoly Jackpot</strong> tickets can still be entered into  Second Chance Drawings through the Red Carpet VIP Club website.</p>
                            <p>The $10<strong> Monopoly Jackpot</strong> instant game features top instant  prizes of $1,000,000 and up to five Second Chance Drawings, each with a top  prize of $200,000.&nbsp; There will also be  one Grand Prize Drawing with a top prize of $5,000,000.</p>
